Installing Percona XtraDB Cluster
=================================

Install |PXC| on all hosts that you are planning to use as cluster nodes

using the corresponding package manager for your system:

* :ref:`Debian or Ubuntu <apt>`

* :ref:`Red Hat or CentOS <yum>`

Installation Alternatives

Percona also provides a generic tarball with all required files and binaries
for manual installation:

If you want to build |PXC| from source, see :ref:`compile`.

If you want to run |PXC| using Docker, see :ref:`docker`.
